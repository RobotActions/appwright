# Appwright

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/appwright?color=4AC61C)

Appwright is a test framework for e2e testing of mobile apps. Appwright builds on top of [Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/), and can
run tests on local devices, emulators, and remote device farms — for both iOS and Android.

Appwright is one integrated package that combines an automation driver, test runner and test
reporter. To achieve this, Appwright uses the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) test runner internally, which is
purpose-built for the e2e testing workflow.

Appwright exposes an ergonomic API to automate user actions. These actions auto-wait and auto-retry
for UI elements to be ready and interactable, which makes your tests easier to read and maintain.

```ts
import { test, expect } from "appwright";

test("User can login", async ({ device }) => {
  await device.getByText("Username").fill("admin");
  await device.getByText("Password").fill("password");
  await device.getByText("Login").tap();
});
```

## Usage

### Minimum requirements

- Node 18.20.4 or higher

### Install

```sh
npm i --save-dev appwright
touch appwright.config.ts
```

### Configure

```ts
// In appwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, Platform } from "appwright";
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "android",
      use: {
        platform: Platform.ANDROID,
        device: {
          provider: "emulator", // or 'local-device' or 'browserstack'
        },
        buildPath: "app-release.apk",
      },
    },
    {
      name: "ios",
      use: {
        platform: Platform.IOS,
        device: {
          provider: "emulator", // or 'local-device' or 'browserstack'
        },
        buildPath: "app-release.app", // Path to your .app file
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Configuration Options

- `platform`: The platform you want to test on, such as 'android' or 'ios'.

- `provider`: The device provider where you want to run your tests.
              You can choose between `browserstack`, `lambdatest`, `robotactions`, `emulator`, or `local-device`.

- `buildPath`: The path to your build file. For Android, it should be an APK file.
               For iOS, if you are running tests on real device, it should be an `.ipa` file. For running tests on an emulator, it should be a `.app` file.

### Run tests

To run tests, you need to specify the project name with `--project` flag.

```sh
npx appwright test --project android
npx appwright test --project ios
```

#### Run tests on BrowserStack

Appwright supports BrowserStack out of the box. To run tests on BrowserStack, configure
the provider in your config.

```ts
{
  name: "android",
  use: {
    platform: Platform.ANDROID,
    device: {
      provider: "browserstack",
      // Specify device to run the tests on
      // See supported devices: https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/app_automate
      name: "Google Pixel 8",
      osVersion: "14.0",
    },
    buildPath: "app-release.apk",
  },
},
```

#### Run tests on LambdaTest

Appwright supports LambdaTest out of the box. To run tests on LambdaTest, configure
the provider in your config.

```ts
{
  name: "android",
  use: {
    platform: Platform.ANDROID,
    device: {
      provider: "lambdatest",
      // Specify device to run the tests on
      // See supported devices: https://www.lambdatest.com/list-of-real-devices
      name: "Pixel 8",
      osVersion: "14",
    },
    buildPath: "app-release.apk",
  },
},
```

#### Run tests on RobotActions

Appwright supports [RobotActions](https://robotactions.com) real-device grids out of the box.
Install this fork, set `ROBOTACTIONS_GRID_URL` and `ROBOTACTIONS_TOKEN` in your environment,
host the build somewhere the grid can download it, and configure the provider in your config.
Test names and pass/fail land on the grid dashboard, and each session's recording is attached
to the Playwright report.

```sh
npm install github:RobotActions/appwright
```

```ts
{
  name: "android",
  use: {
    platform: Platform.ANDROID,
    device: {
      provider: "robotactions",
      // Optional: pin a device by UDID / OS version / class ("TV" gets an
      // Android TV); omit them all to take any free device
      udid: "R5CT30XXXXX",
      osVersion: "14",
    },
    // A build from your App Library ("ra-app://<id>"), an http(s) URL, or a
    // path on the grid host — the grid installs it.
    // Leave it out for a device-level session or a preinstalled app.
    buildPath: "ra-app://8eb08fc5-7a19-4037-bafe-c1437d855340",
    appBundleId: "com.example.app",
  },
},
```

## Run the sample project

To run the sample project:

- Navigate to the `example` directory.

```sh
cd example
```

- Install dependencies.

```sh
